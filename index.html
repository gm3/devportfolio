					Hello, my name is Godfrey Meyer, a Full Sail University Recording Arts Grad from 06. I have been working in music production a number of years, producing music for many TV networks, and tv shows. Some of those credits include MTV, VH1, Comedy Central, BET, Bravo, SyFy, Discovery Channel, Spike, NAT Geo, NBC, Nick, Oxegen TV, Sundance, TLC, Travel Channel, and many others! Currently I have been working in Virtual Production, software dev, C#, Unity3d, and creating Virtual Reality Studios, producing and filming music videos inside VR!

                <h3>Virtual Reality Development And Production</h3>
                <h4>VR Game Dev and Production</h4>
                <p>
I create Production environments for live broadcast and virtual performance inside VR using Unity3d. This is a extremely new concept, and I am active in the VR development communities of "Social VR". I create and produce 3D content, stages, and custom production environments for Virtual Productions. We use 3D avatars to blog, podcast and create digital media content using game engines to revolutionize traditional pipelines. I create virtual "soundstages" and create advanced cameara rigs with animation to meet any production needs. Some of the studios I have built are the, VR Recording Studio, and a Green Screen Studio, as well as podcast rooms with custom production tools. We stream from these rooms, and film music videos over the network in realtime. I have produced over 10 music video inside VR, and I continue to create custom sets for others in live broadcast and virtual performace as well as continue to create content for my own music releases.               </p>

                <h4>Recording Audio Engineer</h4>
                <p>
I was a recording engineer on the My Music Series - PBS, and recorded live big budget shows, traveling to 5 countries on tour with a crew. I gained lots of expierence working under lots of pressure, and strict deadlines. I was resposible for setting up stage audio, and rigs to record these live shows with 100s of artists, and bands from the 50s, 60, 70s. I then did post production editing on all of the audio from the shows.                </p>

            <h4>Associate Degree Recording Arts</h4>
            <p>
               At Full Sail I studied the ins and outs of engineering music, and audio post production. During my studies I worked on many projects and acedamia with other students in other programs, developing an interest in all media production from game development, to film making. With music being my passion and focus, I have went on to produce music professionaly after graduation and work as a recording engineer in commercial studios, tours, and run my freelance business from a home studio.

I have created a Recording Studio inside Social VR where people can join together over the internet and make music inside VR. This is a project I have been working on inside social VR. We also have made full production studio environments with custom tools to use VR as a medium to make music videos, films, skits, live broadcasts and more. I have been very active in the "vTuber" movement, where people are creating 3D avatars and using 3D spacial computing as a foundation for making content and multimedia. I build the environment and bring production expierence to this emerging feild of "Virtual Production". Check out some behinds the scenes of how we produce music videos inside VR with this video:                         </p>

                            On new years, Deadmau5 (Producer) and Justain Roiland (Voice Actor For Rick and Morty) used my virtual production set inside VR to film and produce a spot for his live performance on new years. We filmed actors as avatars in realtime over the network, and with a custom green screen production set. This footage was composited with CGI, and projected onto his live set with success.
